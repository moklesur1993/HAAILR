Feeding Convolutional Neural Network with Hand-crafted Features Improves Human Activity and its Intensity Level Recognition.


In this study, we have extracted a set of features from tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, magnetometer, and orientation sensors positioned at different places of the body. Then, these features have been fed to a CNN. In particular, we have demonstrated
that feeding an appropriate set of feature to a CNN might increase its performance in HAIILR with low computational cost. The recognition accuracy of the proposed method has been compared for dierent modalities and positioned at dierent body places (wrist, chest, and ankle) on a publicly available
PAMAP2 dataset. The proposed study provides cross-individual validation accuracy of 98.88% and 98.70%, respectively for human activity (HA) and its intensity level recognition.
